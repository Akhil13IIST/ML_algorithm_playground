# ML Algorithm Playground ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository is a **Machine Learning Algorithm Playground**, where I implement **ML algorithms from scratch** without using `scikit-learn`. The goal is to deeply understand each algorithm by coding it from first principles.

## Algorithms Covered
### âœ… **Phase 1: Core ML Algorithms**
- [x] Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### ðŸ”œ **Phase 2: Advanced ML**
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- [ ] Boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost, etc.)
- [ ] Dimensionality Reduction (t-SNE, ICA)

### ðŸ”œ **Phase 3: Deep Learning & RL**
- [ ] Neural Networks (MLP, CNNs, RNNs)
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, DQN)
